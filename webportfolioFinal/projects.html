                <p>Using GIMP, I created a minimalistic poster to emphasize the importance of protecting personal information and to raise awareness about phishing and other scams. This design employs a simple but effective visual metaphor of a hook and lock (a play on the word 'phishing') that could easily be adapted for future marketing campaigns. </p>

                <p>Using Adobe InDesign, I brought a quote to life, using design to enhance and breathe vitality into its message. My approach avoids excessive layering, focusing instead on color and font. In my digital art journey, I've developed a preference for an open, spacious style, characterized by clear text, solid colors, and minimal textures to ensure readability. </p>

                <p>Using Adobe InDesign and Illustrator, I created a concise booklet featuring simple recipes tailored for students and beginner cooks. As a college student myself, I often faced the challenge of not knowing what to cook due to limited experience and kitchen resources. Over the years, I've experimented with various recipes and compiled those I regularly prepare into this collection. The goal of this booklet is to provide a practical foundation for people looking to start their cooking journeys, as there are numerous benefits to cooking at home. </p>
                <p>Each recipe is presented in a clear and straightforward manner, avoiding unnecessary details to respect the reader's time and encourage them. To add an element of fun and cohesion, I used InDesign and Illustrator to create graphics, opting for solid colors and a cartoon style to enhance the booklet's simplicity and educational focus.</p>

        <div class = "beachText">
            <p>Using Audacity, I created a sound project that narrates a trip to the beach, which takes an unexpected turn due to inclement weather. I curated around 20 different sounds from various free audio websites, meticulously editing and layering them to craft this simple story. The goal was to create an immersive experience that evokes feelings of happiness, nostalgia, relaxation, and a hint of uncertainty. This project was inspired by my own desire to recreate a pleasant experience, with the beach serving as an ideal setting often associated with good weather and leisure. While the storyline is straightforward, I enjoy the idea that listeners can project their own experiences onto the sounds and interpret the narrative in their own way.</p>

            <p>Using Arduino, physical computing, and C++, I recreated a pivotal scene from children's classic The Lorax, a commentary on the perils of greed and its role in environmental destruction, with an emphasis on encouraging readers to proactively engage in addressing these issues. The project features a push button that activates an axe to chop down a Truffula tree, symbolizing the Once-ler's destructive decision. A second motor flips the background from a lush forest to a barren desert, and LED lights enhance the vibrant world. This project, inspired by The Lorax, aims to engage users of all ages in reflecting on their environmental impact.</p>
